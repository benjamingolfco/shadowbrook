# Tee Time Platform — Feature Roadmap (by Audience)

---

## Features Both Golfers AND Courses Will Love

These create value for both sides of the marketplace equally.

### Core (v1)
- **Remote waitlist with SMS notifications** [#3] — golfers get the times they want; courses fill cancellations automatically
- **Walk-up waitlist with course-set discounts** [#29] — golfers get a deal; courses fill empty slots with warm bodies already on-site
- **Credit card on file, no upfront charge** [#30] — golfers aren't punished for weather or life; courses still have accountability
- **No-show fee charged to card** [#32] — golfers who show up aren't affected; courses recover lost revenue
- **Free cancellation up to 30 minutes before** [#36] — golfers get flexibility; courses get advance notice to backfill
- **Tee-time-first browsing** [#2] — golfers find times faster; courses get discovered by golfers who wouldn't have searched for them specifically
- **SMS via Twilio** [#3] — golfers get updates in a channel they actually read; courses get 90%+ open rates instead of 20% email

### Enhanced (v2)
- **Skill-based group matching** [#50] — golfers get better-matched rounds; courses see fewer pace complaints and smoother flow
- **Conversational SMS booking** [#51] — golfers book effortlessly via text; courses capture bookings from people who'd otherwise call the pro shop or give up
- **Post-round pace feedback via SMS** [#52] — golfers feel heard; courses get actionable data

### Future (v3)
- **Window-based booking** [#80] — golfers get better-matched groups and smoother pace; courses get optimized throughput and fewer gaps
- **Day-of group optimization** [#82] — golfers play with compatible players; courses maximize filled slots per window
- **Real-time tee time assignment via SMS** [#86] — golfers know exactly when to show up; courses maintain flexible scheduling

## Features Courses Will Love (Golfers Won't Notice or Care)

These are operator tools that improve the business behind the scenes.

### Core (v1)
- **Operator dashboard** [#1] — tee sheet view, pricing management, fill rate analytics, cancellation recovery tracking
- **Booking for 1–4 players with structured data** [#2] — clean player info for check-in and operations

### Enhanced (v2)
- **Auto-interval suggestions** [#54] — data-driven recommendations for spacing tee times to reduce pace problems
- **Pace and booking pattern analytics** [#57] — trends by day/time, booking lead times, no-show rates by segment
- **Walk-up discount analytics** [#58] — conversion rates by day/time so operators can optimize their discount strategy

### Future (v3)
- **Throughput-per-window analytics** [#85] — true capacity data per time window
- **Starter dispatch tools** [#91] — shift the starter from traffic cop to optimizer with real-time group assembly

## Features Golfers Will Love (Courses May Not Care About)

These improve the golfer experience directly but don't move the needle much for operators.

### Core (v1)
- **Handicap stored in golfer profile** [#41] — set it once, never asked again. Better group matching without friction
- **Single responsive web app** [#2] — one clean interface instead of juggling aggregator apps, course websites, and phone calls

### Enhanced (v2)
- **GHIN handicap sync** [#66] — serious golfers get auto-updated handicap without manual entry

### Parked
- **Native mobile app** — golfers would love it, but the responsive web app covers this for now
- **Course profiles** — photos, scorecard, reviews, amenities. Nice for discovery but not essential yet
- **Dynamic pricing** — golfers who are flexible benefit from deals, but this is complex to implement
- **Starter scanner check-in** — skip the clubhouse, go straight to the tee. Convenience play
